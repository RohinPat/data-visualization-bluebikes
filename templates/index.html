            <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
            <p>This project analyzes Boston's BlueBikes bike-sharing system data to understand urban mobility patterns and user behavior. By examining trip data from January 2025, we aim to uncover insights about how different types of users utilize the system, identify popular routes and stations, and understand temporal patterns in bike usage.</p>
            
            <h3>About the Data</h3>
            <p>The dataset comes from BlueBikes' publicly available system data, containing detailed records of bike trips. Each trip record includes information such as start/end times and locations, user type, and trip duration. The data has been analyzed to reveal patterns in station usage, temporal trends, and user behavior across different areas of Boston and Cambridge.</p>

                    <h3>Station Distribution and University Impact</h3>
                    <p>The map reveals a clear concentration of high-volume stations (larger circles) around university areas, particularly MIT and Harvard. These stations consistently show 2-3 times more activity than stations in non-university areas. MIT's stations along Mass Ave and Vassar Street are among the busiest in the system, highlighting the success of university partnerships and student discount programs.</p>

                    <h3>Top Stations Analysis</h3>
                    <p>The station ranking analysis reinforces the critical role of university partnerships. MIT-affiliated stations dominate the top spots, with MIT's Mass Ave/Amherst St station leading by a significant margin. The high volume at these stations (200+ daily trips) correlates with student discount programs and proximity to classes. Harvard Square and Central Square stations also show strong performance, demonstrating how university stations serve as crucial links between campuses and public transit.</p>

            <p>These visualizations reveal when people use BlueBikes throughout the day and week.</p>

                    <h3>User Composition Across the Week</h3>
                    <p>This visualization shows a clear weekday-weekend divide in both volume and user composition. During the workweek, members drive system usage with routine commuting patterns. On weekends, however, casual riders become a more dominant segment, even as total volume drops. These trends highlight Bluebike’s dual purpose: weekday utility for members and weekend leisure for casuals—reinforcing the need for targeted messaging, pricing, and service availability tailored to each audience.</p>

                    <h3>Distributional Differences in Ride Duration by Time of Day</h3>
                    <p>This visualization reinforces the pattern that members use Bluebike for efficient, predictable transportation, particularly during rush hours, while casual users take longer, more variable trips—likely tied to leisure or exploration. The contrast in density and spread between the two user types is most apparent during Midday, Evening, and Night, when casual riders extend trip length considerably. Violin plots make it clear that system design and marketing should accommodate these distinct use cases.</p>

                    <p>These visualizations highlight the stark contrast between utilitarian and recreational Bluebike use. Members primarily ride during weekday commuting hours, while casual users favor mid-day and weekend travel, consistent with flexible or leisure-oriented behavior. Peak-hour congestion, especially for members, reinforces the system’s role in urban mobility, while weekend flattening indicates an opportunity for tourism-focused outreach and system balancing.</p>

                    <h3>Weekly Usage Patterns</h3>
                    <p>The heatmaps emphasize distinct rhythms in bike usage: commuters (mostly members) ride intensely during weekday rush hours, while casual users favor late mornings and afternoons, particularly on weekends. The dual commute peaks visible Monday through Friday give way to a flattened midday rise on weekends. Member vs. casual heatmaps underscore this split clearly—routine vs. recreation. These insights reinforce the need for time-based bike rebalancing and targeted user strategies.</p>

        <section class="conclusions">
            <h2>Key Findings</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>University partnerships drive system success: Stations near MIT and Harvard show consistently higher usage, with some locations handling over 200 trips daily, demonstrating the effectiveness of student discount programs.</li>
                <li>Clear commuter patterns: Member rides show distinct rush-hour peaks and consistent trip durations, indicating reliable commuter usage patterns aligned with academic and work schedules.</li>
                <li>Dual-purpose system: BlueBikes effectively serves both commuter needs (shorter, routine trips) and recreational use (longer, variable-duration trips), with clear temporal separation between these use cases.</li>
                <li>Transit hub integration: High-volume stations near major transit points (e.g., Kendall/MIT, Harvard Square) suggest successful integration with public transportation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Future Work</h2>
            <p>Future analysis could explore:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Impact of seasonal weather patterns on ridership, particularly around academic calendars</li>
                <li>Effectiveness of student discount programs in driving adoption rates</li>
                <li>Relationship between station usage and proximity to public transit connections</li>
