            <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
            <p>This project analyzes Boston's BlueBikes bike-sharing system data to understand urban mobility patterns and user behavior. By examining trip data from January 2025, we aim to uncover insights about how different types of users utilize the system, identify popular routes and stations, and understand temporal patterns in bike usage.</p>
            
            <h3>About the Data</h3>
            <p>The dataset comes from BlueBikes' publicly available system data, containing detailed records of bike trips. Each trip record includes information such as start/end times and locations, user type, and trip duration. The data has been analyzed to reveal patterns in station usage, temporal trends, and user behavior across different areas of Boston and Cambridge.</p>

                    <p>The map reveals a clear concentration of high-volume stations (larger circles) around university areas, particularly MIT and Harvard. These stations consistently show 2-3 times more activity than stations in non-university areas. MIT's stations along Mass Ave and Vassar Street are among the busiest in the system, highlighting the success of university partnerships and student discount programs.</p>

                    <h3>Top Stations Analysis</h3>
                    <p>The station ranking analysis reinforces the critical role of university partnerships. MIT-affiliated stations dominate the top spots, with MIT's Mass Ave/Amherst St station leading by a significant margin. The high volume at these stations (200+ daily trips) correlates with student discount programs and proximity to classes. Harvard Square and Central Square stations also show strong performance, demonstrating how university stations serve as crucial links between campuses and public transit.</p>

                    <h3>Member vs Casual Usage Throughout the Week</h3>
                    <p>The weekly usage comparison dramatically illustrates the impact of university and commuter memberships. Member rides dominate weekdays with nearly triple the volume of casual rides, peaking at over 1,200 trips mid-week. The sharp drop in member usage on weekends, contrasted with steady casual ridership, further emphasizes BlueBike's dual role in serving both commuter and recreational needs.</p>

                    <p>The violin plot reveals the distribution of trip durations throughout the day, split by member type. The width of each "violin" shows how common different trip durations are, while the median line provides a central reference point. This visualization highlights how casual riders tend to take longer trips, especially during midday hours, while members show more consistent, shorter duration patterns typical of commuting.</p>

                    <p>The stark contrast between weekday and weekend usage patterns reinforces BlueBike's dual role in Boston's transportation ecosystem. Weekdays show pronounced peaks during typical commute hours (7-9AM and 4-6PM), with volume nearly doubling during these times. Weekend usage follows a more leisurely pattern with a single afternoon peak, suggesting recreational use. This pattern strongly correlates with university class schedules and traditional work hours.</p>

                    <p>The heatmap reveals consistent high-volume periods during weekday commute hours, particularly intense on Tuesday through Thursday. The clear distinction between weekday and weekend patterns, combined with the concentration around university areas, suggests that BlueBikes serves as a crucial last-mile solution for students and workers connecting to public transit hubs.</p>

        <section class="conclusions">
            <h2>Key Findings</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>University partnerships drive system success: Stations near MIT and Harvard show consistently higher usage, with some locations handling over 200 trips daily, demonstrating the effectiveness of student discount programs.</li>
                <li>Clear commuter patterns: Member rides show distinct rush-hour peaks and consistent trip durations, indicating reliable commuter usage patterns aligned with academic and work schedules.</li>
                <li>Dual-purpose system: BlueBikes effectively serves both commuter needs (shorter, routine trips) and recreational use (longer, variable-duration trips), with clear temporal separation between these use cases.</li>
                <li>Transit hub integration: High-volume stations near major transit points (e.g., Kendall/MIT, Harvard Square) suggest successful integration with public transportation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Future Work</h2>
            <p>Future analysis could explore:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Impact of seasonal weather patterns on ridership, particularly around academic calendars</li>
                <li>Effectiveness of student discount programs in driving adoption rates</li>
                <li>Relationship between station usage and proximity to public transit connections</li>
